# NetHawk

Yeap, another Network Scan.

The primary intention of this tool is not to serve as a replacement for nmap or rustscan, but rather to complement the work of Penetration Testers and Security Analysts. This tool proves particularly useful when, for some reason, reconnaissance must be performed on a client’s network and the client’s security policies prohibit the use of personal machines. In such instances, equipment provided and regulated by the client must be used, and Group Policies may disallow the installation of any additional tools. This tool is designed to operate effectively within such environments, providing valuable support in network security analysis
